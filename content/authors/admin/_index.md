      Responsibilities include:
      - Designed a power-efficient sleep stage classifier for wearable devices by bypassing 54.5\% EEG signals to low-powered classifiers with a novel confidence-based switch, which reduces 32.7\%-77.8\% FLOPS with insignificant 1.9\% accuracy drops (IEEE BigData 2024)
      - Developed a multi-entity healthcare instruction recommender system for elders, incorporating unique demands of elders, diversities of individual multidisciplinary doctors, and their consensus-building process, resulting in 5-10\% improvement in NDCG on synthetic data generated by domain experts (UHIMA\&TLCMA 2025)
      - Delivered in-person lectures on supervised learning, recommender systems, and real-time bidding as part of the Data Mining course (2025 Spring), totaling 9 hours

      Responsibilities include:
      - Leveraged viewer-streamer interactions on live streams and proposed a tensor co-factorization recommendation system, which reduces nearly 50\% model parameters compared to SOTA methods (CIKM 2020)
      - Identified a novel scenario of Virtual Reality (VR) group shopping and designed an effective recommender system and a query system, respectively (CIKM 2019 and VLDB 2020)
      - Cooperated with experts from different domains, including Sociology (6 teams), Physics and Biology (15 teams from 4 research institutes), and developed machine learning models for social sentiment analysis and drosophila neuron identifications (Physics Reports 2023)
      - Organized and analyzed results of four user studies and managed large-scale crowd-sourcing data annotations in four papers (one published in AAAI 2018, two in CIKM 2019, and one in VLDB 2020)
